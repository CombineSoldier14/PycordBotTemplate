# Example Bot
This is a Pycord based bot template made for easy and quick bot creation. Simply edit `info.json` and `devinfo.json` (if the bot is running in dev mode) to get your bot information, and open up `cogs/default.py` and `cogs/system.py` (for function shortcuts, if you would like) and start coding!
